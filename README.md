# Currency Converter

Objective: Design multiple classes (Currency, CurrencyConverter) that perform the following functionalities:

Currency:
- Perform essential operations like multiplication, addition, and subtraction on objects with like currency codes.
- Identify equivalent and nonequivalent object attributes (amount, code).
- (Missing) Accept a string that includes a monetary symbol for one argument, and assign the appropriate amount and code attributes to an object. Maintain original functionality of accepting two arguments (amount, code) to initialize Currency class.

CurrencyConverter:
-(Unsuccessful test) Accept the amount and currency code of one currency "object" in order to return its converted amount and currency code. Must accurately output converted figures.
- Uses reference library of conversion rates for stored currencies.

Next steps:

-Test and resolve outstanding bugs.
-(?) Develop main.rb for control flow and sequencing. Get and process user input for amount and currency code values.
